# iou_mask
This is a iou-tracker implementation for [KITTI Data](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) based on [Bochinski's iou-tracker](https://github.com/bochinski/iou-tracker) using KITTI's [pycocotools.masks](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/mask.py) in RLE format.

Parameters needs to be improved based on extensive search.
